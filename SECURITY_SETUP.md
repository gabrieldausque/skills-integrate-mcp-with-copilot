# MCP GitHub Integration Setup

## Security Issue Resolved ✅

The push rejection has been fixed! The issue was that your personal access token was accidentally included in the git commit, which GitHub automatically detected and blocked to protect your security.

## What I Fixed:

1. **Removed the problematic commit** containing your token
2. **Updated mcp-config.json** to use environment variables instead of hardcoded tokens
3. **Enhanced .gitignore** to prevent future token exposure
4. **Created .env.example** as a template for secure configuration

## Next Steps:

### 1. Create your local environment file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### 2. Add your token to .env (this file will NOT be committed):
```
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_actual_github_personal_access_token_here
```

### 3. Your mcp-config.json now safely uses environment variables:
```json
{
  "env": {
    "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "${GITHUB_TOKEN}",
    "GITHUB_REPOSITORY": "gabrieldausque/skills-integrate-mcp-with-copilot"
  }
}
```

## Security Features Added:
- ✅ .env files are ignored by git
- ✅ Token files are blocked from commits  
- ✅ Configuration uses environment variables
- ✅ No sensitive data in repository

Your repository is now secure and ready for pushing!
